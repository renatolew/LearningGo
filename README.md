Repository to register my first steps in Go. Contains exercises of programming logic, most common used Go libraries and a couple small projects to practice those concepts. 

This repository's main goal is to act as complementary content to Go students in Comunidade CoDe, a brazilian programming community, so here you will find code ranging from the very beginning of learning about computer science to some functional projects focused on the market needs. There will be files in english and portuguese to make the repository accessible to students that don't speak english, so a couple files may have similar code with comments in different languages.

The material in this repository follows instructions from two very good Go learning courses. You can find the original source below:

1- Free course "Aprenda Go" by Ellen from 'Aprenda Go': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiGU_ZB-u0w&list=PLCKpcjBB_VlBsxJ9IseNxFllf-UFEXOdg
2- Paid course "Aprenda Go do Zero!" by Ot√°vio Augusto Gallego at 'Udemy': https://www.udemy.com/course/aprenda-golang-do-zero-desenvolva-uma-aplicacao-completa/


To do the exercises in this repository and run any code you find here, you need Go programming language installed in your computer, and I recommend using an IDE or text editor to make your life easier. You can find links below to install Go and Visual Studio Code (my recommended text editor):

Go download center: https://go.dev/dl/
VS Code download page: https://code.visualstudio.com/

For any doubts or questions, you can find me on LinkedIn or via e-mail, as listed in my profile description.
